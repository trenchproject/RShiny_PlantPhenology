### Relationships between temperature and First Flowering Date (FFD)

In this exercise, you can generate figures showing either annual or monthly temperatures on the x-axis and FFD on the y-axis, for five  common Eastern wildflower species that were included in the historic and modern datasets. 


<h4>Wildflower species</h4>

<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table class="alt">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Scientific Name</th>

2. For chicory (Cichorium intybus), create separate scatter plots of FFD and average temperatures in September, January, May, and July. Add a linear trend line and include its R2 and equation on the plots. Include these plots (one for each month) with your responses. 
a.	Which month shows the strongest correlation between average temperatures and FFD, in terms of R2? Which have the largest (or most negative) slope? 
b.	Propose a hypothesis for why this is the case. What aspects of plant physiology might be impacted by temperatures at different times of year? 


## Interspecific Comparisons and Ecological Impacts
3.	For each species, create a scatter plot of FFD as a function of average temperatures in January. Add a linear trend line and include its R2 and equation on the plots. Include these plots (one for each species) with your responses. 
a.	How many species show negative correlations between temperature and FFD (ie FFD decreases as temperature increases) ? 
b.	Which species shows the most negative relationship between FFD and temperature? The most positive?  
c.	Propose a hypothesis for why some species show higher or lower slopes in regressions of FFD and temperature.
