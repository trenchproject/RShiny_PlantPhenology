# Temperature and Plant Phenology

##Question
How do changes in climate influence plant phenology? 

##Background
In plants, the onset of developmental processes like germination and flowering is influenced by both day length and temperature. Changes in climate may lead to shifts in the seasonal timing of these processes, with substantial impacts for both natural and agricultural systems. “Phenology” refers both to the timing of these cyclic life history events and the science of studying them. In many areas of the world average temperatures have increased over 1.5°C since the late 19th century, suggesting that changes in plant phenology may be observable in the historic record. 

We will be working with a dataset of climate records and the first flowering dates (FFD) of five species of plant found in Concord, Massachusetts (the site of Thoreau’s Walden Pond). The plant data were collected by two observers: Alfred Hosmer, a shopkeeper and amateur botanist who recorded FFD’s around Concord from 1893-1903; and a team from Boston University [1] who resurveyed the town roughly a century later in 2003-2006. Climate records were collected at the Blue Hill meteorological observatory in Milton, MA, which has recorded daily temperature and precipitation since 1852 [2].

##Change in Temperature Over Time
1. Examine the plot of the annual average temperatures as a function of time.
a.	About how much has Concord’s average temperature increased since the 1890’s? (Hint: look at the trendline, not the raw data). Is this more or less than expected by the IPCC report? 
b.	If the current trend continues, what will the average annual temperature in Concord be in 2075?
