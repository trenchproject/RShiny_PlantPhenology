## Phenological Responses to Climate Change: A Wildflower Case Study

### Temperature and Phenology 

For many organisms, temperature has a major influence on phenology—the timing of important life events such as when birds migrate or when plants flower—and scientists across the world have been documenting phenological shifts in response to climate change, like deciduous trees producing new leaves <a href="https://www.usanpn.org/files/LeafOutHighlightChange_Arnoldia_.pdf">earlier</a> in the year because spring-like temperatures are arriving sooner. FOr a visual depiction, compare the images of a cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts on memorial day in 1868 and in 2005. This kind of research often relies heavily on historic records of phenology, which allow us to track changes in the average timing of events of interest across many decades, and compare them to climate data collected over the corresponding period of time.

Plants living in seasonal environments use many sensory cues, including temperature, day length, and water availability, as signals to help them decide when to start developmental processes like germination and flowering. The photo below shows one of the most common responses: plants flower earlier when temperatures are warmer. 


The timing of flowering is a particularly important phenological event for plants, because many species rely on insects and other animals as pollinators. If flowering occurs too early or too late in the season (e.g. before bumblebees emerge from winter diapause), a plant and its pollinators may not be in synchrony. If this happens, both parties are at a considerable disadvantage—plants cannot reproduce, and pollinators lose a food source. Flowering earlier in the season can also expose delicate blooms to a greater risk of damaging spring frosts.

### Massachusetts Wildflowers: Then and Now

You may remember the story of Henry David Thoreau and how he meticulously recorded the first leaf-out and flowering dates for hundreds of wildflower species over several years in the 19th century—we talked about this in the <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#Historical-Data" target="_blank">Historical Data</a> section of our website. After Thoreau died, a shopkeeper named Alfred Hosmer who lived in the same town as Thoreau and greatly admired his writings took it upon himself to continue his records. Hosmer collected data from 1893 to 1903, and a century later, a group of researchers based in the research group of <a href="https://www.rprimacklab.com/">Richard Primack Lab</a> at Boston University realized that they could use both Thoreau and Hosmer's records as a baseline to help them understand the impacts of climate change on plant phenology. Between 2003 and 2006, Primack, graduate student Abe Miller-Rushing, and a team resurveyed the same species in the same area once again. They combined the plant data with climate data from the Blue Hill meteorological observatory in Milton, MA, where daily temperature and precipitation measurements have been taken since 1852. In the images on this page, you can see a photographic depiction of phenological changes, a statue of Thoreau outside his Walden cabin, an a page of Thoreau's phenological observations organized as a chart in his diary.

### Exploring records of climate change

In this interactive app, you’ll be able to visualize changes in climate over time, as well as examine relationships between temperature and plant phenology—specifically the First Flowering Date (FDD) of different species in different years. By selecting which variables to plot against each other, you can ask questions and test hypotheses about climate change and the timing of flowering, and about how different plant species respond to temperature.

Below is a figure that will allow you to look at changes in temperature over a period of 122 years (1893-2015). There is a lot of natural variability in the data (i.e. differences between individual years), so to help you see broad longterm patterns, look at the blue trendline instead of the scattered datapoints.
