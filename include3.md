#Synthesis and Study Design

4.	Consider the Miller-Rushing & Primack 2008 paper assigned for discussion (this is a subset of the data used for their analyses). 
a.	What impacts could changing FFDâ€™s have on other species (including animals) in the ecosystem? 
b.	How could the data used in this study be improved? What other sources of data can be used to study changes in phenology or abundance of species over time?
